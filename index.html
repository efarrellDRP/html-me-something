				The Earth can be a harsh and unforgiving environment for the unsheltered organism.
				Harsh weather patterns, seasonal changes, and natural disasters are among the few things that can throw an Ecosystem’s nutrient cycles completely out of whack.
				With these nutrient cycles in disarray, most of the organisms that inhabit these ecosystems won’t be able to sustain themselves and they’ll have to leave in search of a new nutrient source or die trying.
				We see this when animals migrate to a new environment in search of food or water, and then again with extinction events.
				However, some organisms have adapted a method of ignoring these problems, and it’s a surprise that these organism are among the Earth’s smallest.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bacteria of the <span>Firmicute</span> phylum have acquired an adaptation that allows them to enter a dormant stage when deprived of key nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorous) or faced with environmental dangers.
				This stage sees the bacterium change into an endospore, a pseudo-spore that consists of the bacterium’s DNA, ribosomes, proteins, and large amounts of <span>pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid</span> (dipicolonic acid).
			</p>
			<p>
				Endospores are incredibly resistant to high temperature, UV irradiation, dessication, chemical damage, and enzymatic damage.
				Not only that but the endospore can survive without nutrients, and live for centuries (or even millions of years in the proper conditions) until external conditions are favorable enough for the endospore to begin to germinate into bacterial cells again.
